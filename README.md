# Profile Page

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to practice my HTML, CSS & JavaScript skills by creating a profile page that displays some basic information about myself. I created the page in a few hours using mostly HTML & CSS but with some JavaScript to impliment some of the harder features, such as the animated background.

## Secondary Purpose
The other purpose of the project was to practice using GIT to publish the project on GitHub using the command line. This process included creating a new repo, pushing an initial commit, creating a new branch and pulling requests.
